//! Self-contained tests for the settlement once-only guard (issue #1198).
//!
//! These tests deliberately do **not** depend on the crate's `tests/` module tree, which is
//! currently disabled pending reconciliation with the lib API (see the note near the end of
//! `lib.rs`). Instead they drive the public [`LiquifactEscrow`] surface directly, so the
//! reentrancy / double-application guard can actually be exercised by `cargo test` today.
//!
//! Guards under test (in [`LiquifactEscrow::settle`]):
//! - the settled marker (`status == 2` + [`crate::DataKey::SettledAt`]) is committed
//!   **before** the outward [`crate::EscrowSettled`] event;
//! - a second settlement of the same escrow is rejected with the dedicated typed error
//!   [`crate::EscrowError::EscrowAlreadySettled`] rather than being double-applied.
